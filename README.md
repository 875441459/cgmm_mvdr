This program is a implementation of " ROBUST MVDR BEAMFORMING USING TIME-FREQUENCY MASKS FOR ONLINE/OFFLINE ASR IN NOISE" for chime3/chime4 data

This is a Comoplex Gaussian Mixture Model (CGMM) based MVDR beamforming;

I just implement the batch process of the paper.

The old verison has been moved to branch old_toy_mvdr
